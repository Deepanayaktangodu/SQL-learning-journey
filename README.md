# SQL-learning-journey
# My Daily SQL Practice Journey 🚀

Hello! I'm Deepa Nayak — a former Health & Wellness Coach turned aspiring Data Analyst.

This repository is a personal, hands-on project to strengthen my SQL skills through **daily practice**, using self-created datasets and real-world inspired questions. I’m building this one step at a time, one dataset at a time — to grow not just as a coder, but as a data thinker.

## ✨ Why I Started This

When I began my transition into data analytics, I was overwhelmed.

Cheat sheets didn’t stick. Tutorials made sense until I had to write a query on my own. That’s when I realized — **what I needed wasn’t more theory. I needed practice.**

This project is about **deliberate, consistent practice** — not just to learn SQL, but to learn how to think in SQL.
